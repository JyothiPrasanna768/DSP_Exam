Given a signal x[n] at some radar transmitter (read 'radar.txt' ). Assume the signal is transmitted and reflected as y[n] with additive random noise w[n] i.e.,y[n]=x[n-n0]+w[n] where n0 (choose n0<200) is the total delay or time elapsed in receiving the reflection. Detect the total delay n0 given x[n] and y[n].
